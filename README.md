## Installation
First download this theme to your `themes` directory:

```bash
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/verpeteren/gutenberg-paralax.git
```
and then enable it in your `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "paralax"
```

## Options 

### Options - General


#### Logo

Set the `logo` to be used in the navbar and the side bar.
Probably obvious, but transparent logo's work best.

```toml
[extra.paralax]
logo = "http://placehold.it/300x300"
```

#### Links

Set list of `links` to be used in the navbar and the side bar.
Please note, that `tags` and `categories` will be added when these are activated in the site's `config.toml`.


```toml
[extra.paralax]
links = [
    {url = "/", name = "Home"},
    {url = "/blog", name = "Blog"},
]
```

#### Color scheme

It is possible to tweak the some colors. It is not ideal, but it works.

```toml
[extra.paralax.colorscheme]
font = {one = "teal", two="brown", three = "white"}
```

#### Footer

There are 3 blocks in the footer: 

```toml
[extra.paralax.footer]
```

##### Bio

Just a `title` and a `description`.

```toml
[extra.paralax.footer.bio]
title = "Company Bio"
description = "Bla bla bla bla bla. Rubarb Rubarb, Rubarb. Yada yada yada. Bla!"
```

##### References

Just a `title` and a list of `links`.

```toml
[extra.paralax.footer.references]
title = "References"
list = [
    {url = "http://example.com", name="example 1"},
    {url = "http://example.com", name="example 2"},
]
```

##### Contact

Just a `title` and a list of `links`.

```toml
[extra.paralax.footer.contact]
title = "Contact"
list = [
    {url = "mailto://me@example.com", name="mail"},
    {url = "tel://003123456789", name="phone"}
]
```

### Social

The `side bar` can hold a lot of social icons. Some highlights:

* The activation of google analitics has never been easier.
* The most annoying one is the skype icon.
* The most interesting one is `disqus` entry. This is also active on the `content pages`.

```toml
[extra.paralax.social]
ga = "UA-12345678-9"
discuss = "verpeteren"

facebook = "verpeteren"

```

### Options - index page

The paralax template makes it easy to create a nice landing page by ust configuring some sections in the configuration file: `text`, `images`, and `features`,

```toml
[extra.paralax.index]
text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, .."
```

The paralax is based around 3 `images` that give a nice effect during scrolling. 
The sections in the config are labeled `one`, `two` and `three`.
Every image needs to have  `file`/`alt` combination. The files need to be 1440 px wide.
It is optional to set `title`, `subtitle` and a `call to action`. It probably needs some fiddling with the text length and the colors.

#### Images

```toml
[extra.paralax.index.images]

[extra.paralax.index.images.one]
file = "background1.jpg"
alt = "Design thingking by Patrick Perkins"
title = "gutenberg paralax template"
subtitle = "Modern opionated responsive front-end framework Material Design static templates"
cta = { url = "/blog", name = "get started" }
```

#### Features

There are 3 colums with each a [`icon`](http://materializecss.com/icons.html), `title` and a block of `text`.
The coluns in the config are labeled `one`, `two` and `three`.

```toml
[extra.paralax.index.features]

[extra.paralax.index.features.one]
icon = "flash_on"
title ="Reason one"
text = "Bla Bla Bla. Bla, ... "
```
